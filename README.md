Description
===========
This repo contains notes and scripts stemming from my (Lionel Debroux) work [fuzzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) various pieces of FLOSS, some of which are popular, since late 2014.
As of 2019/08, the target OS is Debian 10 "Buster" amd64.

The folder structure is as follows:

* root folder: this README, plus common scripts (e.g. for building fuzzers);
* sub-folders: one per target.

Public announcements for the results of my work:

* [Many issues in "module" / "track" music decoders...](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/11/02/8) ;
* [Fun with DBM-type databases...](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/06/17/1) ;
